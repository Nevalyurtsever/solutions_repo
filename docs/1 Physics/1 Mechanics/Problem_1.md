1. Theoretical Derivation
   The equations of motion for projectile motion can be derived using Newton’s second law. Assuming no air resistance, the motion is governed by the kinematic equations:

Horizontal motion:

𝑣

cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
𝑡
x(t)=v

​
cos(θ)t
(Constant velocity since no acceleration acts horizontally)

Vertical motion:

(Acceleration due to gravity acts downward)

To determine range
𝑅
R, we find the time of flight by setting

Substituting this into the horizontal displacement equation:
