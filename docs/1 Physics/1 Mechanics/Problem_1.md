1. Theoretical Derivation
   The equations of motion for projectile motion can be derived using Newton’s second law. Assuming no air resistance, the motion is governed by the kinematic equations:

(Constant velocity since no acceleration acts horizontally)

Analysis and Observations
The maximum range occurs at 45°, as expected from the range equation.

The range is symmetric about
45
∘
45
∘
, meaning angles like 30° and 60° result in the same range.

Increasing
𝑣
0
v
0
​
increases the range, while increasing
𝑔
g decreases it.

Limitations: This model assumes no air resistance, which in real-world scenarios would shift the optimal launch angle slightly lower.
