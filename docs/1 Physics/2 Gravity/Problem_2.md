Task 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities
2.1 Definitions and Physical Meaning:
The escape velocity is the minimum velocity an object needs to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body, without further propulsion. The three cosmic velocities are:

First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): The velocity needed to stay in a stable orbit around a celestial body.

Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): The velocity needed to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body (e.g., Earth, Mars, Jupiter).

Third Cosmic Velocity (Escape from Solar System): The velocity needed to escape the gravitational pull of the entire solar system.

2.2 Mathematical Derivations:
First Cosmic Velocity:

Where:

𝐺
G = Gravitational constant

𝑀
M = Mass of the celestial body

𝑟
r = Distance from the center of the celestial body (orbital radius)
