1. Derivation of Kepler's Third Law for Circular Orbits (with Code)
   Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits states that the square of the orbital period
   𝑇
   T is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius
   𝑟
   r, i.e.,

𝑇
2
∝
𝑟
3
T
2
∝r
3

We derived this relationship using Newton's Law of Gravitation and centripetal force.

Steps:
Gravitational Force:
The gravitational force between two bodies is given by:

# 𝐹

𝐺
𝑀
𝑚
𝑟
2
F=
r
2

GMm
​

where:

𝐺
G is the gravitational constant,

𝑀
M is the mass of the central body,

𝑚
m is the mass of the orbiting object,

𝑟
r is the distance between the two bodies.
