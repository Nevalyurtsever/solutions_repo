Here's a paraphrased version of the entire task while preserving all technical content and meanings , and not altering the equations or conclusions : Problem 1 1-1. Theoretical Derivation The motion of a projectile can be described using Newton's second law. When air resistance is neglected, the kinematic equations govern the system: Horizontal motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] (This is uniform motion as there is no horizontal acceleration.) Vertical motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] (Gravity acts downward, causing vertical acceleration.) To compute the range \\(R\\) , determine the time when the projectile returns to the ground by setting \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Substitute this into the horizontal position equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta)\\) , the range formula becomes: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] 1-2. Theoretical Analysis of the Range Equations of Motion Projectile motion without air resistance can be modeled as: Horizontal displacement: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical displacement: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Where: \\(v_0\\) is the initial speed, \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration. Time of Flight To find how long the projectile stays airborne, solve \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range Equation Insert \\(t_f\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Applying the identity again gives: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] Analysis & Observations The maximum range is achieved at a 45\u00b0 launch angle. The range is symmetric around 45\u00b0, meaning 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 yield the same result. Increasing \\(v_0\\) leads to a larger range. Higher \\(g\\) values reduce the range. Limitation: Air resistance is not accounted for, which would reduce the ideal launch angle slightly below 45\u00b0 in real situations. 1-3. Key Equations of Projectile Motion 1.

Steps: Gravitational Force: The gravitational force between two bodies is given by: \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5f 2 F= r 2 GMm \u200b where: \ud835\udc3a G is the gravitational constant, \ud835\udc40 M is the mass of the central body, \ud835\udc5a m is the mass of the orbiting object, \ud835\udc5f r is the distance between the two bodies. 1-2 Summary of Kepler's Third Law Implications: Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period \ud835\udc47 2 T 2 is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius \ud835\udc5f 3 r 3 . This has key implications in astronomy: Longer Periods for Larger Orbits: Objects farther from the central body have longer orbital periods. This helps explain why outer planets take much longer to orbit the Sun than inner planets. Predicting Orbital Characteristics: Kepler's Third Law enables the calculation of orbital periods and distances for celestial bodies, helping us understand their motion and behavior. Determining Central Masses: If we know the orbital period and radius, we can calculate the mass of the central object (e.g., Earth, Sun) using the rearranged formula: \ud835\udc40 4 \ud835\udf0b 2 \ud835\udc5f 3 \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc47 2 M= GT 2 4\u03c0 2 r 3 \u200b Real-World Example: The Moon's orbit around Earth is an example. Using its orbital radius and period, we can estimate the Earth's mass. 1-3 Derivation and Formula (Kepler's Third Law) Kepler\u2019s Third Law relates the square of the orbital period \ud835\udc47 2 T 2 to the cube of the orbital radius \ud835\udc5f 3 r 3 , for circular orbits. The law is mathematically expressed as: \ud835\udc47 2 \u221d \ud835\udc5f 3 T 2 \u221dr 3 More precisely, for any two objects orbiting the same central body, we can express the relationship as: \ud835\udc47 1 2 \ud835\udc47 2 2 = \ud835\udc5f 1 3 \ud835\udc5f 2 3 T 2 2 \u200b T 1 2 \u200b \u200b r 2 3 \u200b r 1 3 \u200b \u200b Where: \ud835\udc47 1 T 1 \u200b and \ud835\udc47 2 T 2 \u200b are the orbital periods of two objects. \ud835\udc5f 1 r 1 \u200b and \ud835\udc5f 2 r 2 \u200b are the orbital radii of the two objects. Gravitational Formulation for Orbital Period: The orbital period for an object orbiting a central mass \ud835\udc40 M can be derived from Newton's law of gravitation and is given by the formula: \ud835\udc47 2 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc5f 3 \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc40 T=2\u03c0 GM r 3 \u200b \u200b Where: \ud835\udc47 T is the orbital period, \ud835\udc5f r is the orbital radius (distance from the central object), \ud835\udc3a G is the gravitational constant, \ud835\udc40 M is the mass of the central object (e.g., the Sun or Earth). This formula allows us to calculate the orbital period if we know the orbital radius and the mass of the central body. 1-4 4.1 Derivation of the Equation for a Forced Damped Pendulum A forced damped pendulum is a system where a pendulum experiences both damping forces and an external periodic driving force.

For small-angle oscillations (where sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \u2248 \ud835\udf03 sin(\u03b8)\u2248\u03b8), the equation becomes: \ud835\udc51 2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 2 2 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udf14 0 2 \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udc39 0 cos \u2061 ( \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc61 ) dt 2 d 2 \u03b8 \u200b +2\u03b3 dt d\u03b8 \u200b +\u03c9 0 2 \u200b \u03b8=F 0 \u200b cos(\u03c9t) This is a second-order linear differential equation that describes the motion of the damped and driven pendulum. Key Behavior: Resonance: When the driving frequency \ud835\udf14 \u03c9 matches the natural frequency \ud835\udf14 0 \u03c9 0 \u200b , the system experiences resonance, leading to large oscillations.

This has key implications in astronomy: Longer Periods for Larger Orbits: Objects farther from the central body have longer orbital periods. This helps explain why outer planets take much longer to orbit the Sun than inner planets. Predicting Orbital Characteristics: Kepler's Third Law enables the calculation of orbital periods and distances for celestial bodies, helping us understand their motion and behavior.
