Here's a paraphrased version of the entire task while preserving all technical content and meanings , and not altering the equations or conclusions : Problem 1 1-1. Theoretical Derivation The motion of a projectile can be described using Newton's second law. When air resistance is neglected, the kinematic equations govern the system: Horizontal motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] (This is uniform motion as there is no horizontal acceleration.) Vertical motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] (Gravity acts downward, causing vertical acceleration.) To compute the range \\(R\\) , determine the time when the projectile returns to the ground by setting \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Substitute this into the horizontal position equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta)\\) , the range formula becomes: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] 1-2. Theoretical Analysis of the Range Equations of Motion Projectile motion without air resistance can be modeled as: Horizontal displacement: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical displacement: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Where: \\(v_0\\) is the initial speed, \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration. Time of Flight To find how long the projectile stays airborne, solve \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range Equation Insert \\(t_f\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Applying the identity again gives: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] Analysis & Observations The maximum range is achieved at a 45\u00b0 launch angle. The range is symmetric around 45\u00b0, meaning 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 yield the same result. Increasing \\(v_0\\) leads to a larger range. Higher \\(g\\) values reduce the range. Limitation: Air resistance is not accounted for, which would reduce the ideal launch angle slightly below 45\u00b0 in real situations. 1-3. Key Equations of Projectile Motion 1.

Project Summary: Simulation & Analysis of Projectile Motion Motivation: Projectile motion is a foundational topic in physics, illustrating the effects of angle and velocity on a body\u2019s trajectory. While simple, it reveals principles relevant to many fields, such as ballistics or sports. Objective: Create a computational model that simulates projectile motion and visualizes how the range varies with launch angle, taking into account variables like velocity, gravity, and height. Implementation Strategy: Mathematical Framework: Horizontal motion: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Where: \\(v_0\\) = initial speed \\(\\theta\\) = launch angle \\(g\\) = gravitational acceleration Computational Model: Use Python , leveraging NumPy for numerical calculations and Matplotlib for plotting. Simulation Tasks: Calculate the range for varying launch angles. Plot range vs. angle graphs under different initial speeds and conditions. Adjust gravity and initial height to observe their effects. Visual Outputs: Range vs. angle plots for multiple velocities. Visualization of optimal launch angles depending on speed. Evaluation: Analyze how different parameters affect motion and range. Determine the angle that maximizes range in various scenarios. Model Assumptions: This simulation assumes: No air resistance Constant gravitational field Flat ground level Future Considerations: Examine how resistance, wind, and launch height alter trajectories.
