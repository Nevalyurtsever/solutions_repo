Here's a paraphrased version of the entire task while preserving all technical content and meanings , and not altering the equations or conclusions : Problem 1 1-1. Theoretical Derivation The motion of a projectile can be described using Newton's second law. When air resistance is neglected, the kinematic equations govern the system: Horizontal motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] (This is uniform motion as there is no horizontal acceleration.) Vertical motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] (Gravity acts downward, causing vertical acceleration.) To compute the range \\(R\\) , determine the time when the projectile returns to the ground by setting \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Substitute this into the horizontal position equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta)\\) , the range formula becomes: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] 1-2. Theoretical Analysis of the Range Equations of Motion Projectile motion without air resistance can be modeled as: Horizontal displacement: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical displacement: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Where: \\(v_0\\) is the initial speed, \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration. Time of Flight To find how long the projectile stays airborne, solve \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range Equation Insert \\(t_f\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Applying the identity again gives: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] Analysis & Observations The maximum range is achieved at a 45\u00b0 launch angle. The range is symmetric around 45\u00b0, meaning 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 yield the same result. Increasing \\(v_0\\) leads to a larger range. Higher \\(g\\) values reduce the range. Limitation: Air resistance is not accounted for, which would reduce the ideal launch angle slightly below 45\u00b0 in real situations. 1-3. Key Equations of Projectile Motion 1.

Analysis of Dynamics (Summary) The behavior of a forced damped pendulum depends on three main parameters: Damping ( \ud835\udefe \u03b3): Low damping allows sustained oscillations and sharp resonance. High damping suppresses motion and reduces resonance. Driving Amplitude (A): Small amplitudes produce regular, periodic motion. Large amplitudes can lead to complex or chaotic behavior. Driving Frequency ( \ud835\udf14 \u03c9): When near the natural frequency, the system experiences resonance, with large oscillations. Away from resonance, the system may still show periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic motion depending on \ud835\udc34 A and \ud835\udefe \u03b3. As parameters change, the pendulum can transition from simple harmonic motion to chaos, often through a process called period doubling. These behaviors are best visualized using time series, phase portraits, and Poincar\u00e9 sections. 2-1-3 3. Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum model has practical relevance in several real-world systems where oscillations under damping and external forcing are important: Energy Harvesting Devices: The model is used in devices designed to capture energy from mechanical vibrations, where the pendulum\u2019s motion can be tuned for optimal energy extraction under periodic forces. Suspension Bridges: Forced damped oscillations are critical in understanding the behavior of suspension bridges under periodic wind forces or traffic loads, especially in resonance conditions which can lead to structural failure. Oscillating Circuits: In electronics, driven RLC circuits (resistor-inductor-capacitor) exhibit similar behavior to a forced damped pendulum, making the model applicable for analyzing resonance and damping in circuits. Biomechanics (Human Gait): The model can be adapted to understand human locomotion, where damping and periodic forces (from walking) interact. It can help in the design of prosthetics or the study of movement disorders. 2-1-4 4. Implementation Objective: In this section, we'll focus on creating advanced simulations of the forced damped pendulum system. This includes: Bifurcation diagrams to explore how system behavior changes with varying parameters. Poincar\u00e9 sections to reveal chaotic dynamics. Phase portraits to visualize the trajectories in phase space. Bifurcation Diagram: A bifurcation diagram is a powerful tool to visualize how the long-term behavior of a system (like the forced damped pendulum) changes as a parameter (typically the driving amplitude \ud835\udc34 A) is varied. This reveals transitions from periodic motion to chaotic behavior, showing the \"route to chaos\" (period doubling). Poincar\u00e9 Section: This tool helps to analyze periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic dynamics by sampling the system at fixed intervals of the driving period. The structure of the Poincar\u00e9 section helps identify whether the system follows regular oscillations or chaotic motion. Phase Portrait: In phase space ( \ud835\udf03 , \ud835\udf03 \u02d9 \u03b8, \u03b8 \u02d9 ), the system's trajectory provides insights into its dynamics. A limit cycle indicates regular oscillation, while chaotic systems show erratic, non-repeating paths.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"2-1-1 Theoretical Foundation \ud83e\udde0 Governing Differential Equation: The forced damped pendulum is governed by the nonlinear second-order differential equation: \ud835\udc51 2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 2 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udf14 0 2 sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) = \ud835\udc34 cos \u2061 ( \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc61 ) dt 2 d 2 \u03b8 \u200b +\u03b3 dt d\u03b8 \u200b +\u03c9 0 2 \u200b sin(\u03b8)=Acos(\u03c9t) \ud835\udf03 ( \ud835\udc61 ) \u03b8(t): Angular displacement \ud835\udefe \u03b3: Damping coefficient \ud835\udf14 0 = \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc3f \u03c9 0 \u200b = L g \u200b \u200b : Natural angular frequency \ud835\udc34 A: Amplitude of the driving force \ud835\udf14 \u03c9: Frequency of the external driving force \ud83d\udd0d Small-Angle Approximation: When \ud835\udf03 \u03b8 is small ( < 0.2 rad <0.2rad), we can linearize the equation using: sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \u2248 \ud835\udf03 sin(\u03b8)\u2248\u03b8 Thus, the equation becomes: \ud835\udc51 2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 2 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udf14 0 2 \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udc34 cos \u2061 ( \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc61 ) dt 2 d 2 \u03b8 \u200b +\u03b3 dt d\u03b8 \u200b +\u03c9 0 2 \u200b \u03b8=Acos(\u03c9t) \u2705 Analytical Solution (General Form): This is now a second-order linear non-homogeneous ODE.

It can help in the design of prosthetics or the study of movement disorders. 2-1-4 4. Implementation Objective: In this section, we'll focus on creating advanced simulations of the forced damped pendulum system. This includes: Bifurcation diagrams to explore how system behavior changes with varying parameters. Poincar\u00e9 sections to reveal chaotic dynamics. Phase portraits to visualize the trajectories in phase space. Bifurcation Diagram: A bifurcation diagram is a powerful tool to visualize how the long-term behavior of a system (like the forced damped pendulum) changes as a parameter (typically the driving amplitude \ud835\udc34 A) is varied. This reveals transitions from periodic motion to chaotic behavior, showing the \"route to chaos\" (period doubling). Poincar\u00e9 Section: This tool helps to analyze periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic dynamics by sampling the system at fixed intervals of the driving period. The structure of the Poincar\u00e9 section helps identify whether the system follows regular oscillations or chaotic motion. Phase Portrait: In phase space ( \ud835\udf03 , \ud835\udf03 \u02d9 \u03b8, \u03b8 \u02d9 ), the system's trajectory provides insights into its dynamics. A limit cycle indicates regular oscillation, while chaotic systems show erratic, non-repeating paths.","title":"\ud835\udc35"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 1-1 Derivation of Kepler's Third Law for Circular Orbits (with Code) Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits states that the square of the orbital period \ud835\udc47 T is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius \ud835\udc5f r, i.e., \ud835\udc47 2 \u221d \ud835\udc5f 3 T 2 \u221dr 3 We derived this relationship using Newton's Law of Gravitation and centripetal force.
