Here's a paraphrased version of the entire task while preserving all technical content and meanings , and not altering the equations or conclusions : Problem 1 1-1. Theoretical Derivation The motion of a projectile can be described using Newton's second law. When air resistance is neglected, the kinematic equations govern the system: Horizontal motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] (This is uniform motion as there is no horizontal acceleration.) Vertical motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] (Gravity acts downward, causing vertical acceleration.) To compute the range \\(R\\) , determine the time when the projectile returns to the ground by setting \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Substitute this into the horizontal position equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta)\\) , the range formula becomes: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] 1-2. Theoretical Analysis of the Range Equations of Motion Projectile motion without air resistance can be modeled as: Horizontal displacement: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical displacement: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Where: \\(v_0\\) is the initial speed, \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration. Time of Flight To find how long the projectile stays airborne, solve \\(y(t) = 0\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range Equation Insert \\(t_f\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Applying the identity again gives: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta) \\] Analysis & Observations The maximum range is achieved at a 45\u00b0 launch angle. The range is symmetric around 45\u00b0, meaning 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 yield the same result. Increasing \\(v_0\\) leads to a larger range. Higher \\(g\\) values reduce the range.

Here's a comprehensive and readable English version of the content you provided, including explanations and relevant images. \ud83e\ude90 Problem 1: Kepler\u2019s Third Law for Circular Orbits 1.1 Derivation of Kepler\u2019s Third Law Kepler\u2019s Third Law states that the square of the orbital period \\(T\\) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius \\(r\\) : \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This relationship can be derived using Newton's Law of Gravitation and the concept of centripetal force. Derivation Steps: Gravitational Force: Newton's Law of Gravitation provides the force between two masses: $$ F_{\\text{gravity}} = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} $$ Where: \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun), \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting object (e.g., a planet), \\(r\\) is the distance between the two masses. Centripetal Force: For circular motion, the necessary centripetal force is: $$ F_{\\text{centripetal}} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} $$ Equating the Forces: Setting gravitational force equal to centripetal force: $$ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} $$ Simplifying: $$ v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} $$ Relating Velocity to Period: The orbital period \\(T\\) is the time it takes to complete one orbit: $$ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} $$ Substituting \\(v\\) : $$ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} $$ Therefore: $$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G M} $$ This derivation confirms that \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , which is Kepler\u2019s Third Law. Illustration: Source: Wikipedia - Kepler's laws of planetary motion 1.2 Implications of Kepler\u2019s Third Law Longer Periods for Larger Orbits: Planets farther from the Sun have longer orbital periods. For example, Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit. Predicting Orbital Characteristics: Knowing the distance of a planet from the Sun allows us to calculate its orbital period, and vice versa. Determining Central Masses: Rearranging the derived formula: $$ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} $$ This allows us to calculate the mass \\(M\\) of the central body if \\(r\\) and \\(T\\) are known. \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Problem 2: Forced Damped Pendulum 2.1 Theoretical Foundation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is described by the nonlinear second-order differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Where: \\(\\theta(t)\\) : Angular displacement, \\(\\gamma\\) : Damping coefficient, \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) : Natural angular frequency, \\(A\\) : Amplitude of the driving force, \\(\\omega\\) : Frequency of the external driving force. Small-Angle Approximation: For small angles ( \\(\\theta < 0.2\\) rad), \\(\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta\\) , simplifying the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a linear non-homogeneous second-order differential equation. Solution Components: Homogeneous Solution (Transient): $$ \\theta_{\\text{hom}}(t) = C_1 e^{-\\gamma t / 2} \\cos(\\omega_d t) + C_2 e^{-\\gamma t / 2} \\sin(\\omega_d t) $$ Where \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - (\\gamma/2)^2}\\) is the damped natural frequency. Particular Solution (Steady-State): $$ \\theta_{\\text{part}}(t) = B \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) $$ Where: \\(B = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (\\gamma \\omega)^2}}\\) , \\(\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{\\gamma \\omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}\\) . Resonance Condition: Maximum amplitude occurs when the denominator of \\(B\\) is minimized: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2}} \\] 2.2 Analysis of Dynamics The behavior of a forced damped pendulum depends on: Damping ( \\(\\gamma\\) ): Low damping: Sustained oscillations and sharp resonance. High damping: Suppressed motion and reduced resonance. Driving Amplitude ( \\(A\\) ): Small \\(A\\) : Regular, periodic motion. Large \\(A\\) : Complex or chaotic behavior. Driving Frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ): Near \\(\\omega_0\\) : Resonance with large oscillations. Away from \\(\\omega_0\\) : Periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic motion depending on \\(A\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) . As parameters change, the system can transition from simple harmonic motion to chaos, often through period doubling. Visualizations: Time Series: Shows how \\(\\theta(t)\\) evolves over time. Phase Portraits: Plots of \\(\\theta\\) vs. \\(\\dot{\\theta}\\) to visualize trajectories in phase space. Poincar\u00e9 Sections: Samples the system at fixed intervals to reveal periodic or chaotic dynamics. Illustrations: Time Series Example: Phase Portrait Example: Poincar\u00e9 Section Example: Source: Wikipedia - Driven damped pendulum 2.3 Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum model applies to various real-world systems: Energy Harvesting Devices: Devices that capture energy from mechanical vibrations can be modeled to optimize energy extraction under periodic forces. Suspension Bridges: Understanding oscillations under periodic forces (like wind or traffic) is crucial to prevent structural failures due to resonance. Oscillating Circuits: RLC circuits in electronics exhibit similar behavior, making the model useful for analyzing resonance and damping. Biomechanics (Human Gait): The model helps in understanding human locomotion, aiding in prosthetics design and studying movement disorders. 2.4 Implementation Objective: Simulate the forced damped pendulum system to analyze its behavior under varying parameters.
